        <p class="rone"> We live in a world that is constantly changing, and education must adapt to support 
            students to be successful in this world. As an educator, it is my job to determine the
            needs of my students and support them in using their strengths to meet the challenges 
            they face. I must be prepared to adapt my teaching practices, modify the learning 
            environment, or provide individual accommodations to ensure learner growth. All 
            students have the right to an education that meets their unique needs, which are as 
            diverse and varied as each learner. My experience as an adjunct professor and 
            elementary teacher has allowed me to learn about two very diverse groups of learners. </p>
            <p class="rone">Adult learners bring their prior life experiences into their learning. Some have sailed 
            through school with academic success, while others have faced challenges and may 
            require extra support to achieve their goals. The students in my web development 
            course have ranged from 20ish computer-savvy students to older adults with little to no 
            computer skills. As this is a skill-based course, all students must complete the exact 
            requirements, but my expectations and support differ. The first student group often 
            moves ahead quickly and asks for support to make their website function more 
            advanced. I can often use videos and links to support their learning, but I must also 
            remind them to check the rubric for requirements. The second group needs one-on-one 
            support. They need exemplars and individual, step-by-step guidance to understand how 
            coding works to create a website that meets the specific course requirements. Both 
            student groups have the right to personal growth and skill development; my job is to 
            adjust my teaching interactions to meet those needs. </p>
            <p class="rone"> Elementary students, on the other hand, are at the beginning of their academic journey. 
            It is a phase where they explore their strengths and passions. My role is to facilitate 
            their growth and instill confidence in their abilities. I believe in their potential and
            constantly reinforce it. I aim to build strong relationships with my students so they feel 
            comfortable taking the necessary risks for their development. I model expectations and 
            provide scaffolding and support for students as they learn new skills. I modify the 
            curriculum or provide accommodations to ensure every student succeeds. When 
            students leave my classroom, they know they can and will learn. </p>
            <p class="rone">>Regardless of age or background, every student deserves an education tailored to their 
            unique needs. As an educator to future teachers, there is an additional responsibility. I 
            must meet the needs of my teacher learners, but I must also prepare them for their 
            future learners. I need to ensure my learners are prepared to meet the diverse needs of 
            their students. A role I am passionate about embracing. To achieve this goal, I am 
            committed to providing a supportive and inclusive learning environment that empowers 
            my learners to succeed in a rapidly changing world. </p>

                <h2>Elementary Teacher</h2>
                <p>I was an elementary teacher in the Anchorage School District for 28 years.  I taught kindergarten - 2nd grade 
                    at 5 different schools, in 9 different classrooms and with over 500 different students. My responsibilities
                extended past the classroom. </p>
                    <ul> 
                        <li>Building Technology Coordinator</li>
                        <li>Math Site-Based Specialist</li>
                        <li>Mentor Teacher</li>
                        <li>504 Coordinator</li>
                        <li>SEL committee Member</li>
                        <li>Math Academic Alignment Leader</li>
                        <li>Host Teacher</li>
                    </ul>
                <p> While my biggest accomplishment was the difference I made in the lives of my students and colleagues, I am
                    proud of being selected as the Presidential Award Winner for Excellent in Teaching Mathematics.  It was an honor
                     that truly changed my life.

                <h2> Mathematics Researcher</h2>
                <p>My desire to become a researcher developed while working on my doctorate at the Unviersity of South Carolina.
                    I was at the end of my elementary teaching experience, but still wanted to make a difference in education. 
                    My dissertation focused on the need for professional development to improved mathematics education.  I studied 
                    the amount, quality and kind of professional development needed to impact teaching practices.
                    This is something I would love to contine to research in hopes of making a significant change in how we 
                    support teachers.

                <h2>Adjunct Professor</h2>
                <p>As an adjunct professor at the University of Missouri, I have had the opportunity to teach a variety of
                    different courses in the School of Information Science & Learning Technologies Deparment.  I have taught
                courses on how to use different LMS systems as well as Web Design and Development.  Teaching college takes a
                different skillset and I have enjoyed learning how to connect with and support the adult learner.  </p>

       <p class="abone">I was born in Anchorage, AK, during its developmental years,
        something I didn't appreciate at the time but significantly 
       impacted my upbringing.  It was a place of wilderness and 
       adventure. My childhood was filled with camping in the
        summer and skiing in the winter. We enjoyed the sun-filled 
       summers and survived the dark nights. We treasured the 
       moose, northern lights, and mountains. At the same time, I was 
       raised in a supportive community where kids played outside 
       together, and all parents watched to ensure our safety.  Due to 
       oil money, opportunities were plentiful with sports, music, and 
       other activities.  Yet, we lived in a remote state.  It was a 5-hour 
       flight just to get out of the state.  Most of us did not have family 
       in Alaska, so friends became family.  This is one of the most 
       important things I value in my life today. </p>
       
       <p class="abone">As I grew up, I knew I wanted to be a teacher and return to
        Alaska to raise my children.  I wanted them to live in this land 
       of opportunity.  Yet, I wanted to see what the <q>real 
       world</q> was like, and went to college in Iowa.  After earning
        my degree in Elementary Education, I returned to teach in 
       Anchorage.  The next 28 years of my life were spent teaching 
       Kindergarten through second grade.  Twenty of these years at 
       Scenic Park Elementary School, where I went to school.</p>
       
       <p class="abone">After that many years, I was looking for a change.  I wanted to
        be involved in education but in a different way. I decided to
        pursue my doctorate in STEM education.  My specific focus 
       became mathematics education.  My dissertation focuses on 
       the need and type of professional development that would be 
       effective in helping teachers change their mathematical 
       teaching practices.  It ignited a new flame to make a difference. 
       I want to help teachers so they, in turn, can help their students 
       to be better mathematicians. </p> 
       <br>
       <strong>This is the new journey in which I embark…</strong>
